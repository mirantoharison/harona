In any case to Nancy St Jean!!! This is beyond bad faith.\n\nI am accompanying my goddaughter to buy a birthday gift.\nShe finds happiness with a necklace, but expresses a reservation to the saleswoman because certain jewelry causes allergies in the person who will receive the jewelry.\nThe saleswoman informs her that there is no risk of allergy with Pandora products because they are quality jewelry and with the chamois \"provided\" by wiping the chain regularly the jewelry will not oxidize.\nMy goddaughter pays for her purchase of a necklace for ‚Ç¨69, I ask her for the receipt which indicates ‚Ç¨74!!!!\nI immediately returned to the store, the saleswoman \"C\" told me that she had informed me that the chamois was sold at the price of ‚Ç¨5! She is adamant this is HER sales pitch.\nAnyway, I tell her I don't want it, so she gives me a voucher to use \"only\" in the boutique on rue St Jean.\nMy partner goes back the next day, ultimately the voucher is valid in any store. But when she refused, she filled out a form to obtain an exceptional reimbursement.\nHe was contacted to let him know that the manager had accepted, he must return to the store with the credit card that was used to pay for the purchase (we obviously do not have it since my goddaughter returned home).\nSo I go there and present the voucher and my credit card, and the saleswoman tells me that the card is not necessary since the amount will be refunded to me in (small) change.\n\nSo many contradictions for a single person, well done Mrs. you must have good sales figures and rarely come across clients of which I am one who do not let themselves be taken care of."

And even more so when it's done well. So CONGRATULATIONS TO NANCY‚ÄôS TEAM!! You are very professional, keep smiling! I would continue to come back to you and recommend with my eyes closed."

This is how this director works who warns you 4 months before taking charge that in fact: ‚Äúwe no longer have space‚Äù meaning ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you‚Äù. So here we are without any childcare arrangements for September... Where a true professional ignores his moods, Mrs. C. prefers to penalize a child and hides behind false excuses, frankness is not part of her register . Avoid or ask for written confirmation at the risk of finding yourself without means of care at the last moment depending on the director's wishes.\nI expect a frank response from Mrs. C. to this opinion..."

Dead insects on the edge of the window and stuck to this same greasy wall. Apart from the kitchen in the center of the corridor, the one at the end is really lacking in cleanliness despite the well-washed plates and levers. The elevator is often dirty as are the corridors.\n\nIn addition, the single washing machine and dryer is sometimes complicated. The laundry piling up and the line for the machines. A bit of a shame knowing the number of students who live here. There is, however, a laundromat in the next street if the queue is too long.\n\nDespite this, the rooms are large for their price, and well appointed."

Inadmissible. It's been a week that I've been struggling to meet this invisible lady so that she can program my student card."

I never saw him again.\n\nI find this behavior disrespectful and clearly unprofessional, the goal of a salesperson is not to help the customer find what suits them in order to sell? It seems like they didn't quite grasp the concept.\n\nI'm finally very happy not to have spent my money in this store! The city center store has much nicer salespeople!"

So I call beforehand to find out; I am told that only the order form is enough to make an exchange... So I arrive at the store to change with my order form. Following this, a salesman told me that it was not possible and that he had to print a \"return slip\" before coming, trying to be accommodating, he told me that if I managed to get it on the phone he can print it for me. By the time I get this famous voucher on the phone, this seller leaves and I have to deal with a saleswoman who explains to me that they can't do anything for me if I don't have this voucher....\nYou bunch of incompetent people, I don't know if there's a lack of effort from the last person or the first seller who is lost but it's unacceptable.. 3 different versions from 3 different sellers.\nManagers will have to take stock of this."

How convenient it is to bring people in and send them for a walk afterwards because they are late.\nThen we are told, no, Mrs. Xxxxxx does not want to see you, it is clearly a mockery of the patients. More than an hour's drive just for nothing, it's not as if everything in life isn't already expensive enough as it is.

Shameful service and staff who are not attentive. Why work in this type of service if listening, empathy and patience are not there? Why does a caregiver tell me \"that in France\" there are no more hospital beds that the services are supposedly saturated while at the same time we see unoccupied beds and a \"patient\" occupying these same beds? strutting in socks in the corridors, coffee in hand, with his little cigarette breaks outside (because yes, it is important to smoke when you are sick!), and without wearing a mask in the hospital? A mother was unable to stay warm with her minor son because supposedly \"there is a Covid protocol\", please look for the logic!!!  I limped home in front of staff who didn't care at all.

After 10-15 long minutes without any request from the staff we were told that there was no ophthalmologist in the emergency room before 4:30 p.m., or 3:30 later.\nObviously no lead or contact was given to us to resolve the problem. In the end we removed the lens ourselves after many minutes of pain.\nIn conclusion, if you are in difficulty and you have to go to the emergency room, do so from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and not on weekends (don't forget to take your ticket, it's important). Otherwise good luck to you."

I thought they were coming to help me because due to my deafness I couldn't find a VSL... in short, covid makes them execrable... mm the VSL was there pr.

I went to countless specialists who never found anything and only gave me tablets in pills. I was a real drug addict.\n\nThis young neurologist took the time to listen to me which none of the so-called professors had ever done. After 30 minutes he diagnosed paraxytic emicrania and suggested an infiltration. I wasn't very reassured... but everything went very well, he was very kind to me and above all: NO PAIN for 2 months.... that had never happened in 10 years.\n\nA big congratulations to this doctor with a capital M"

I was taken to the emergency room at 7 p.m. for chest pain, I was released at 3 a.m., after only 2 exams which lasted 5 minutes so I clearly spent 8 hours waiting. But of course if we're not dying in front of them we're not taken seriously. I go home with the answer to my pain: \"It might be this, that, that or something else, but since you're not dying, we're not going to help you.\"\n\nIt's time to review your entire operation. The patients were all on edge, an absolutely unjustified wait for everyone.\n\nI came for the first time last March, a lumbar puncture was done 3 times because apparently the emergency doctors don't know how to aim. They applied an anesthetic patch to me, they told me that I had to wait 30 minutes, they came back 1h30 later, of course the patch was no longer really anesthetic... I complained of the pain when he put the needle in but assured me that it's just a nuisance. When are we taken seriously?\nI then spent 2 weeks unable to get up following complications from this failed puncture. A big lack of communication, I was not warned that I had to lie on my back for 1 hour, nor that I needed caffeine to reduce the pain of the puncture. I was once again sent home without a diagnosis, a diagnosis which was found by an on-call doctor within 20 minutes a few days later.\n\nIn short, if you have an emergency I advise you to flee this hospital.\n\nThe only positive point is a student who put more professionalism and respect into her work than her seniors. Thanks to her."

Having come on a Saturday evening with 7 patients before me, I stayed at the reception for 11 hours and I could see that the job is quite pleasant and not very tiring. Maybe it's oral fatigue from chatting or being on your cell phone and what's more, there's no need to be friendly.\nAfter 11 hours of waiting I was able to film a little and take photos. Many are of no use. 8 people chatting at reception, it‚Äôs a laugh. I hope at least it wasn't us. I'll drop you a CV, it will be good for me to rest a little at work."

Help....\nThe emergency department is saturated, doctors, nurses, stretcher bearers, paramedics, caregivers overloaded due to the chronic lack of staff due to the economy. Broken arms, legs, feet, etc.: hours of waiting for an X-ray, a diagnosis, a cast... And it's not new, just it has gotten worse over time. The caregivers don't have much to do with it, the \"thinking\" minds having decided to treat humans like any other material, to make a profit like concrete production. You have the beginning of a heart attack, good luck, the one that one of my relatives did not have, too fit, and then a weekend. Death waiting but dead nonetheless. And then there is the dying wing, old building not renovated for ages, horrible room, horrible neon light, this beautiful green hospital. There the staff is voluntary, otherwise the dying would be accompanied in their death by family, relatives and medical staff. Poor public hospital and Social Security which is a beneficiary this year. At the cost of the lives of patients, yes, how much is a human life? Is the ultimate goal a private health system? While we all contribute rich and poor. But poverty does not have a good press today.\nThe caste system extends to life in its most primary aspect.\nBut when we are panicked by pain, illness, accident we all converge there. To be reassured, cared for, supported by the medical profession. For some time yet. So yes support for caregivers and no for business management which only knows money."

Saturday evening around 7 p.m. my father was taken to the Nancy CHRU rue l'hermite building A 2nd floor room 203 for an amputation of his left thumb and wounds on his right arm. The Nancy CHRU was waiting for him to re-implant it but this intervention required immobilization of at least 7 days and given his professional situation and having my sick grandparents as well as my disabled aunt in his care at home it was impossible for him to accept, and had to make the painful decision to condemn his thumb joint. After that, having certainly taken this choice badly, they finally decided to leave him in a room for 24 HOURS WITHOUT CARE. Before deciding to take him down to the operating room, where he waited another 3 HOURS before finally being operated on, after having been anesthetized in BOTH ARMS.\nI find this irresponsible and unacceptable, because anything could have happened at home in his absence.\n\nMoreover, the result is purely CATASTROPHIC. The wounds are very poorly cared for, threads are coming out everywhere. COTTON was in the wounds.\nResult: purulent and infected wounds.\n\nThis is simply abuse.\nShameful and disgusting."

I understood why when I left the hospital!\nHe managed to get me an appointment very quickly (2:30 p.m. that same day)\nSo I'm going there for 2 p.m. no space... I had to park 10 minutes' walk away, for an \"emergency\" it's great. I go to reception, which is difficult to find if you've never been there. I had to make a (normal) file because it was my first visit to this hospital. And the girl (an Asian with black hair) looks down on me because supposedly my daughter was not registered with me, which is not true, she appears on my CPAM certificates, in short, really haughty. Maybe she wasn't going to send me home. I yelled and she ended up giving me this file and referring me to the ENT. So you have to leave the hospital and go to another building and getting back is really a hassle with a stroller. Then the stroller doesn't fit in the elevator... well done! A building dedicated to children is frankly stupid!\nThe ENT reception sent me to admissions because the other had forgotten to give me the labels, she told me that it was me who forgot them üòÇüòÇüòÇ what nerve. It was 4 p.m. when I finally got to go to the waiting room...\nI have to go back Tuesday... I'm dreading it.\nIn any case, plan to arrive 2 hours before your appointment!"

Nurses not always pleasant in hospitalization in the Atol rating department. We don't treat pain well, which is one of the fundamental things we learn from the start even when studying nursing assistant. In emergency nurses just as unpleasant sometimes. I had a urinary catheter put in while being attacked by a nurse because I couldn't pee on my own. This year, during a simple operation to remove pins from my leg, I contracted a chronic nosocomial lung disease which means that I am vulnerable for life now... In short, it is better to avoid going there unfortunately we rarely have other choices."

We can already talk about Madame Ska who openly criticizes the students in front of the whole class, she told me that I was going to get 0 in the French baccalaureate, ultimately I got 20/20 orally, when she learned it she was very disgusted. Mr. Canizaro is like good wine, you don't like it at first, but over time you love it. Monsieur Mangeot who hates being wrong but who remains a teacher with whom we learn well. Madame Garnier who should wear clothes that fit her rather than criticizing the students who according to her are \"zero\" (her own words). Mr. Cotin and Mr. Vincent in sport are kings, never have so much fun in sport as with them. Besides, all the sports teachers are cool, except Madame Michon Vacelet who forbade me to call my mother who was in the hospital during her stupid sports class at the nursery. A huge thought for Mrs. Caput who was my favorite English teacher throughout my schooling: a love. Besides, travel to England in 2018 on top with you. Finally, Mr. Hennequin who takes pleasure in criticizing students physically to make others laugh. He should eat soup and have thumb surgery before he talks.\n\nPositive honorable mention: Mr. WILLIATTE the PRINCE, Mr. Schmitt who was very nice, Mr. Courapied and Mr. Deutsch, real brothers."

Good memories (PS: for clean toilets girls, go to the CDI).\n\nThe canteen was deplorable and had been voted the worst canteen in the department... Slugs in the spinach, pasta half-cooked in water, poor quality meat, potatoes all the time, cooks with bottles of alcohol on hand. hand... It seems that it was because of a miserly housekeeper.\n\nA diversity which left something to be desired, in my first and final classes, 8% of girls, a maximum for the sector unfortunately...

Run away, the match / crossroads is much cheaper and more balanced since we mainly eat bread and 3 slices of sausage while sometimes only having 30 minutes to eat (which I remind you is completely illegal but loritz has a little protection of the rector... this was seen mainly during the management of covid)\n\nThe administration: then we enter into the son of the subject, a catastrophe. In the 2nd I was put as external instead of internal, no communication between agents, classes that appear at 9 p.m., absences for school trips, hypocrisy for certain people. Nothing is going well, the students are fed up, the teachers are fed up and the parents are fed up.\n\nConclusion: Loritz is good if you ignore the administration and the canteen. Only choose if your option is here or you are in a really crappy area high school\n\nEDIT 2023: I come back to my previous words, the administration is still a bit catastrophic, but it is clearly improving, and that is something positive!!!!"

I am not going to go through 4 paths although they exist: if you are sold a technological baccalaureate course based on concrete facts, know that it is entirely false. The teachers, working methods, toilets, canteen, and facade are all mediocre. In addition, it is absolutely not normal to close study rooms during peak hours, when the students need them the most. Positive points: the workload during my two STI2D years was almost non-existent and the class atmosphere is absolutely exceptional.\nI haven't tried the general baccalaureate so I can't comment on it.\n\nps: word from kos, if you want lessons on Ukraine go with mr sirjacques, completely agree with Alexandre."

The canteen, however, remains to be desired. The dishes are not very tempting, for 4‚Ç¨50, a sandwich at the supermarket next door is three times better. The premises are, from what I have seen, well maintained. Looking forward to doing my BTS there"

No email nothing.\n\nStudent life is non-existent, even more so for certain BTS who are more highlighted than others. High school life, I doubt it exists.\n\nHow is it that a high school in such a big city has so little student/high school life? Unfortunately a good high school also comes down to this criterion.\n\nThe interior is dated, the canteen I have no opinion on since I never went there during my studies."

Not to mention the toilets which are very dirty and sometimes closed for no reason.\n\nAn administrative level of complete nonsense, and as if that were not enough, even more degraded since the health crisis: students are supposed to respect 1m distance in the corridors even though there are more than 2000 students in the high school and approximately 35 students per class (this rule cannot therefore apply and the corridors are shielded between each class); 1 place out of 2 and diagonally across tables of 4 in the canteen, as if that changed something when in the end we still look at each other to speak and we are no further apart than being one in facing each other (especially since in classes, all the places at each table are filled); ban on eating in the courtyard (which is VENTILATED), as if Covid was going to spread more than in the canteen (which is LOCKED) etc...\n\nA 4.0 high school, wifi that works 1 time out of 2 (especially since in most classes we don't use PCs).\n\nA very mediocre canteen with a culinary experience of a quality similar to classrooms (dishes overcooked or undercooked, not seasoned, often repetitive, etc.). Fortunately there are desserts and starters which are pretty good.\n\nThere are still very good teachers, some are very nice too, and thank you to them for teaching us and doing everything possible so that we succeed in our grades/exams/orientation projects."

I would like to detail what is wrong in this school but at this point I just want to know if there is at least one thing that is going well: Horrible and accessible toilets in ONLY ONE place in the school, management of the strawberry administration, aging general architecture, no clarity (no plan, illogical room numbers), canteen quite poor in terms of what is said (I have never eaten there), all this coupled with indecent behavior of a significant portion of students make this school a place of learning that makes us beg for the day to end. Still lucky that the teachers don't have cardboard diplomas, we could have reached the bottom."

No commercial gesture from Alice D√©lice (I made a complaint, to date, no response)! On the other hand, the total amount of the order was debited on the 1st day!!!\nI do not recommend this site at all.\nIt was my first order (I usually go to the store) but because of Covid I preferred online.

Part of the store is dedicated to everything cooking, another to children's cooking, and yet another for chocolate (several choices available), coffee and tea, and there are also oils (truffle flavored, with porcini mushrooms etc) and special vinegars (I even found one with chocolate but not yet tested). And finally there are also arrangements for alcoholic or non-alcoholic aperitifs.\nI hope this has made you want to go there."

In addition, she was very educational in explaining to me what my new presbyopic lenses were going to do to my eyesight.\nIn short; I recommend!"

They don't jump on you like in some stores, you can do your fittings in peace.\n\nAdjustments and repairs are free. I had uncomfortable pads replaced on a new frame, I was offered different sizes to find the most suitable.\n\nA bit of a wait sometimes, but it's not very disturbing."

Result: Gresham's law applies immediately (\"bad money drives out good money\"): everyone uses the nice weights, so that when you arrive in the room, all that's left are the old, ugly weights in your room. arrangement !

The members are friendly and ready to give advice, as are the staff. There is no subscription with commitment, you pay monthly. The classroom is large.\nMy small downside in finding one: the course times, I would like them to have a few more during the week between 12-2 p.m. and in the evening from 6 p.m."

The way they treat newcomers, their condescension in the comments on every other platform, the funeral silence of the gym and the courage of the coaches to tell you *to go elsewhere* if it bothers you. A mess ! I'm glad I didn't even commit. I strongly advise against it. They accuse the competition in the comments so no questioning is possible. They are good and the others are bad! I was happy to find a room with all the activities grouped in one place but no thanks! In addition to the outdated equipment. For this price the least we could have done would have been to at least arrange to have good equipment but no. Should close!"

At first it's 35 euros for a subscription for a student and then it's 59 euros because we're a student and over 25. You might as well put the formula: -25 years, because you can be a student after 25 years‚Ä¶.Which is not at all indicated on the presentation sheet. I logically expected to benefit from this subscription, but obviously that day was not the right one.\nIn addition, the room manager is not very welcoming...need to be seen again.NegativeProfessionalism"

Yes, welcome to Well and Fit, it's the most expensive club in Nancy but there is no air conditioning and the service is not at all up to par. Having been a member of this club for 12 years, I pay 55 euros per month to sweat like hell while students only pay 35 euros per month, why not make the same offer for everyone? In the toilets, it's 60 degrees because they plugged in the air conditioning outlet of the beauty salon.  The weight board is old, the free weights are dilapidated. I do not recommend this club based on a false image."

Avoid if you fear the heat.\nElevator broken (3rd floor: 60 steps). Simple and limited kitchenette equipment (no microwave, crockery reduced to the strict minimum, etc.) No television, contrary to what is advertised.\n\nWe have just received a response from the owner of studio 35 after 16 months!!!. In the tiny kitchen we looked hard but couldn't find the microwave. On the other hand, this studio is rented as a guest room including breakfast, the latter was never served!!! They offered to pick us up a baguette in the morning!!!!",
